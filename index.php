    <p>I would classify myself as a math geek.
        I did my undergrad at the University of Arizona and double majored
        in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics.  My strongest interest is
        in formal logic, complex analysis, and computability.  After I
        graduated, I spent a little over a year working as a mechanical
        engineer in Tucson AZ.  I also met and married my wife Kaitlyn.
        Outside of work and academics, I love to hike when itâ€™s not too hot
        outside, and to ski. I am taking this class as one of the requirements
        for the Software Engineering masters program.
        I did a pretty reasonable amount of programming in school and in my
        free time, and I really look forward to using it in my career!</p>
